# Pentest-Notetaking
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for conducting penetration tests, providing a structured and organized approach to documentation and note-taking. It contains a `.docx` template for the pentest reporting, a notetaking template, and a PDF version of the docx template for easy reference. 

Here's the tree of the notetaking zip file:

The notetaking template is structured into four main sections:

- Overview: This section includes essential documents outlining the objective of the pentest, administrative information, scope and rules of engagement, and the timeline and team members involved.
- Evidence: This section is dedicated to capturing and organizing notes and findings throughout the pentest process. It consists of various subdirectories and files, including notes on credentials, attack paths, activity and payload logs, service enumeration research, vulnerability scan research, web application research, Active Directory (AD) enumeration research, and important open-source intelligence (OSINT) data. Additionally, there is a subdirectory for findings, specifically documenting critical findings such as SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Scans: This section contains subdirectories for different types of scans conducted during the pentest, including AD enumeration, service scans, vulnerability scans, and web application scans.
- Deliverables and Retest: These sections are dedicated to documenting the final deliverables and recommendations resulting from the pentest, as well as any planned or completed retesting activities.

With its well-structured hierarchy and comprehensive set of templates and documentation resources, this repository provides a valuable framework for conducting effective and organized penetration tests. It enables efficient note-taking, evidence gathering, and reporting, ensuring thorough documentation of findings and facilitating the delivery of actionable recommendations to enhance security measures. The directory structure and files in this repository are designed specifically for use with Obsidian.
