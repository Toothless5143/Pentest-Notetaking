# Pentest-Notetaking
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for conducting penetration tests, providing a structured and organized approach to documentation and note-taking. It contains a `.docx` template for the pentest reporting, a notetaking template, and a PDF version of the docx template for easy reference. 

Here's the tree of the notetaking zip file:

- Overview directory: This directory contains the high-level information about the pentest, such as the objective, administrative information, scope and rules of engagement, and timeline and team members.

- Reporting directory: This directory contains the notes, appendices, findings, and remediation summary for the pentest.

- Notes subdirectory: This subdirectory contains the executive summary, attack path, and short walkthrough of the pentest.

- Appendices subdirectory: This subdirectory contains the host and service discovery, subdomains discovery, exploited hosts, credentials and compromised users, changes and host cleanup, and findings.

- Findings subdirectory: This subdirectory contains the specific findings of the pentest, such as a vulnerability with the severity level of "critical".

- Remediation Summary subdirectory: This subdirectory contains the short-term, medium-term, and long-term remediation plans for the findings.

- Research directory: This directory contains the research materials that were used during the pentest, such as websites, hosts, Active Directory (AD) information, logging output, OSINT, wireless information, miscellaneous files, and screenshots.

- Deliverables directory: This directory contains the final deliverables of the pentest, such as the report and presentation.

- Retest directory: This directory contains the information about the retest of the pentest, if applicable.

This is just a sample template, and you may need to adjust it to fit your specific needs. However, it should give you a good starting point for taking notes during your pentests.

**Here are some tips for taking effective pentest notes:**
1. Be detailed and specific. Don't just write down a general overview of what you did. Instead, write down the specific steps you took, the tools you used, and the results you found.
2. Be organized. Use a consistent format for your notes and keep them organized in a way that makes sense to you. This will make it easier to find the information you need later.
3. Be timely. Take notes as soon as possible after you perform a task or find a finding. This will help you to remember the details and avoid making mistakes.
4. Be objective. Don't let your personal opinions or biases influence your notes. Stick to the facts and let the findings speak for themselves.

By following these tips, you can take effective pentest notes that will help you to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.

With its well-structured hierarchy and comprehensive set of templates and documentation resources, this repository provides a valuable framework for conducting effective and organized penetration tests. It enables efficient note-taking, evidence gathering, and reporting, ensuring thorough documentation of findings and facilitating the delivery of actionable recommendations to enhance security measures. The directory structure and files in this repository are designed specifically for use with Obsidian.
